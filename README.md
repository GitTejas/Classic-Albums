# Phase 2 Project: Classic Albums App
Welcome to the Classic Albums React App, where you can share your favorite albums with fellow music enthusiasts! Whether it's a universally acclaimed classic or your personal bias, all submissions are welcome here.

Our frontend web application allows you to easily submit new albums and explore a curated list of 'classic' albums, determined by sales figures. Each entry includes details such as the artist, album name, and track count.

Don't hesitate to add your favorite album to the mix! Even if it hasn't earned widespread recognition as a "classic," your submission is valuable. Let's spark engaging discussions about overlooked gems and timeless favorites alike.

Join us and contribute to the ever-growing collection of beloved albums. Submit away and ignite conversations among fellow music aficionados!

## Functionality
Album Submission: Have we overlooked any albums? Perhaps you believe there are other albums even more deserving of the "classic" title than those currently featured here! We're eager to discover your musical preferences. Remember, music is subjective, so we welcome all musical biases. Share an album that YOU deem as classic, and let's celebrate our diverse tastes in music together! Submit now and let the music discussions begin!

Navigation: Seamlessly navigate through this single-page application using the convenient navigation bar. It's your gateway to effortlessly accessing different sections of the page. Let the navigation bar guide you to where you want to go with ease!
