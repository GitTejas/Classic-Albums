# Phase 2 Project: Classic Albums 
Classic Albums React App (or... your favorite! Bias is fine!).

Welcome to the Classic Albums React App, where you can share your favorite albums with fellow music enthusiasts! Whether it's a universally acclaimed classic or your personal bias, all submissions are welcome here.

Our frontend web application allows you to easily submit new albums and explore a curated list of 'classic' albums, determined by sales figures. Each entry includes details such as the artist, album name, and track count.

Don't hesitate to add your favorite album to the mix! Even if it hasn't earned widespread recognition as a "classic," your submission is valuable. Let's spark engaging discussions about overlooked gems and timeless favorites alike.

Join us and contribute to the ever-growing collection of beloved albums. Submit away and ignite conversations among fellow music aficionados!


## Functionality
Album Submission: Are we missing any albums? Maybe you consider other albums even more classic than the ones we have up here! Let's see your musical taste. Remember music is subjective so we accept any and all musical bias here! Submit an album that YOU consider classic and lets share our tastes in music! 

Filtering: Sort by album sales and if the album went diamond. Now you might have your favorite classic album, but has it gone diamond? Does it matter? This is where we love to discuss all these things!

Navigation: Navigate this single page application with ease by using the navigation bar. This will route you to where you want to go on the page!
